# Dazzle, SparkleShare host setup script

Using FORK by vlaube-de/Dazzle for systemd support
This version adds some minor changes and
add an run script for my needs

An easier and less error prone way to set up a SparkleShare host.
Created to work on Debian and Red Hat based systems.

Feb 2020
This version tries to ensure consistent Environment Variables
by introducing a parameters.sh file. Trying to avoid the mistake
I made initially by running the create option with different variables

## Usage

Usage (as root):

    # Get Dazzle
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbons/Dazzle/master/dazzle.sh \
        --output /usr/local/bin/dazzle
    
    # Initial Dazzle setup
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dazzle
    dazzle setup

    # Link a SparkleShare client
    dazzle link

    # Create a new project
    dazzle create PROJECT_NAME


## Configuration

You can control almost all configuration options via environment variables:

    export DAZZLE_USER=dazzle
    export DAZZLE_HOME=/var/lib/stuff
    sudo dazzle setup

Available options are the following:

* DAZZLE_USER: the Dazzle user. Defaults to "storage".
* DAZZLE_GROUP: the Dazzle group. Defaults to "storage".
* DAZZLE_HOME: the directory used to store projects. Defaults to "/home/storage".
